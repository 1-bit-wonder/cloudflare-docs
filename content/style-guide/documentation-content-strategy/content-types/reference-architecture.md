# Reference architecture

## Purpose

The purpose of a reference architecture is to provide a high-level view of how all or part of the Cloudflare platform is built and how Cloudflare products would fit into a customer's existing infrastructure. Reference architectures are designed to show where our platform fits in with a customer's current environment and describe key aspects of a Cloudflare feature/service. Reference architectures should also map to customer use cases to Cloudflare solutions.
