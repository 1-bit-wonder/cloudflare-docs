# Use Cloudflare R2 as a Zero Trust log destination

This tutorial covers how to build an [R2 bucket](/r2/buckets/) to store logs in, and connect it to the Zero Trust logpush function in the Zero Trust dashboard to have persistent log storage that could then be ingested by an SIEM or exported into another tool.
